## 🚀 Featured Projects

🩺 [**CKD Flask App**](https://github.com/anushkagarg-30/CKD-Flask-App)  
A web application that predicts Chronic Kidney Disease using machine learning and Flask. SMOTE was applied to handle class imbalance, improving F1-score and deployment readiness.

🛫 [**Flight Delay Prediction – Big Data**](https://github.com/anushkagarg-30/Prediction-of-Flight-Delays-using-Big-Data)  
Analyzed and predicted U.S. flight delays using Apache Spark and machine learning at scale. Integrated weather and flight datasets for improved accuracy.

🧠 [**ResNet on CIFAR-10**](https://github.com/anushkagarg-30/Resnet-CIFAR)  
Implemented and trained a ResNet model from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Includes training pipeline, loss/accuracy plots, and model evaluation.
